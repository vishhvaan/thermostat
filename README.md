# DIY IoT Thermostat

This is a package that enables users to make use of cheap temperature (and humidity, barometric pressure, and volatile organic compound gas) sensors and read sensor-generated data into their Home Assistant instance to automate functions around their home.

This repo contains temperature sensor circuit designs, code that runs on a microcomputer to poll the sensor and serve data, and YAML configurations that are loaded into Home Assistant.

Version 1: DS18B20
Version 2: BME680 [Upcoming]
